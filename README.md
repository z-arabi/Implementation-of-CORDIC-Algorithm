# Implementation-of-CORDIC-Algorithm

## Introduction
Trigonometric and hyperbolic functions play an important role in signal processing. An effective and common algorithm for calculating these functions is the algorithm is CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) . The important point about this algorithm is its simplicity and, at the same time, its efficiency, so that in addition to trigonometric functions, this algorithm has the ability to calculate the square root, logarithmic functions, estimating the specific value, and so on.

Another point about this algorithm is that it does not use a multiplier; as a result, this algorithm is suitable for implementation on simple hardware. In general, the Cordic algorithm will work best if we do not have multipliers or the gates required for the design are minimal.

In this project, our focus is on calculating the sine and cosine of an angle using this algorithm.

This algorithm is based on successive rotations of an angle. Therefore, we should calculate the new coordinates after each rotation for the initial angle. This continues until we reach the desired value or achieve the limits.
